# Why Algorithms Matter

An algorithm is a _set of instructions for completing a specific task._

Just like the data structure we choose can affect efficiency, choosing or developing the right algorithm can also affect our efficiency.

## Ordered Arrays

The values are kept in order

A _comparison step_ is a comparison between the value being inserted and the already present value when searching under the hood.

Inserting: searching and shifting elements would take N steps. finding the value that is greater than the value being inserted and inserting the element is 2 steps in total. N + 2

- N steps: [...searching for the greater element, shifting value to right]
- The fewest steps occur when the value needs to insert at the end. N(search) + 1(insert)

### Searching an Ordered Array

Stops the search early when the search_value isn't contained within the array. when iterating on an ordered array, if the element is greater than the serach_value, we can stop the linear search since the value will not be found further within the array.

The standard and ordered arrays have the same worst-case scenario in searching. O(N)
