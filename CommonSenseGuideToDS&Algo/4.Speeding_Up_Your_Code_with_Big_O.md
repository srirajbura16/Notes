# Speeding Up Your Code with Big O

Sorting algorithms account for aligning array elements into ascending order.

### Bubble Sort

The highest unsorted value “bubbles” up to its correct position on every iteration.

- The end value of the previous iteration doesn't need to be compared to the current value because it already bubbled up to its correct position.
- when a swap is conducted on an iteration, one more iteration has to be conducted

### Exercises

1. Replace the question marks in the following table to describe how many steps occur for a given number of data elements across various types of Big O:

   | N Elements | O(N) | O(log N) | O(N2)   |
   | ---------- | ---- | -------- | ------- |
   | 100        | 100  | 7        | 10000   |
   | 2000       | 2000 | 11       | 4000000 |

2. If we have an O(N2) algorithm that processes an array and finds that it takes 256 steps, what is the size of the array?
   1. 16^2
3. Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of the following function. It finds the greatest product of any pair of two numbers within a given array:

   - O(N^2)

   ```python
   def greatestProduct(array):
   	greatestProductSoFar = array[0] * array[1]
   	for i, iVal in enumerate(array):
   		for j, jVal in enumerate(array):
   			if i != j and iVal * jVal > greatestProductSoFar:
   				greatestProductSoFar = iVal * jVal
   	return greatestProductSoFar
   ```

4. The following function finds the greatest single number within an array, but has an efficiency of O(N2). Rewrite the function so that it becomes a speedy O(N):

   ```python
   def greatestNumber(array):
   	for i in array:
   		# Assume for now that i is the greatest:
   		isIValTheGreatest = True
   		for j in array:
   		# If we find another value that is greater than i,
   		# i is not the greatest:
   		if j > i:
   		isIValTheGreatest = False
   	# If, by the time we checked all the other numbers, i
   	# is still the greatest, it means that i is the greatest number:
   	if isIValTheGreatest:
   		return i
   ```

   ```python
   def greatestNumber(array):
   	greatestNumber = array[0]
   	for i in array:
   		if array[i] > greatestNumber
   			greatestNumber = array[i]
   	return greatestNumber
   ```
